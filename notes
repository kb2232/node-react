NODE:
is used to run JS code outside the browser. Traditionally, JS code was executed inside the browser.

EXRPESS:
is a library that runs in the Node runtime - it is consider a node framework. Everything in express, in theory, can be written with pure node. It makes our life easier.

1. app.js 
this is the startup file - root file
modules: 
  - express, 

HEROKU DEPLOYEMENT
- it is good to deploye early to ensure your app is working.

1. heroku requires a few things needed inorder to be deployed.
    1. dynamic port binding - heroku tells us which door number information is coming from. So we need to prep our root file dynamically
    2. node version - we want to use specific version of node and NOT the one heroku tells us to use. So we need to tell heroku which version we are using
    3. npm start - instruct heroku what command to run to start server running
    4. create .gitignore file - we do not want to include dependencies, heroku takes care of that

2. Subsequent deploys
  1.  commit codebase with git
  2.  deploy app with git
